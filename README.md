This repository was originally forked from Bryanne McDonough's Illustris Simulation tutorials. It has now been repurposed for the study on galaxies and their magnetic fields.

The main bunch of code sits in magneticField.ipynb. Admittedly not well structured and not well documented but it got the job done. There is additionally utility functions (such as plotting) in the 'utilities' folder. Some code was graciously provided by Dr. Bryanne McDonough (such as 'iapi_TNG.py' and 'Merger Trees for Sattelite Join Times.ipynb'). Results have been stored in the 'images' and 'rnaas_behind_the_figure' folder.

If one wants to recalculate results, first download TNG data by following the tutorial 'TNGWorkshop_Notebook1.ipynb' in the 'tutorial' folder. Then follow each cell in the magenticField.ipynb.

This work by Dr. Bryanne McDonough and I (Alexander Poulin) resulted in submission to the RNAAS: DOI 10.3847/2515-5172/adce74
